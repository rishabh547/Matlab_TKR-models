## Used 6-DOF Joint To Make The Shagai land Properly from an Inclined Ramp .
## Also Changed Solver Configuration to Fixed-step and Solver:Ode3 For a smoother simulation.
### Made use of Spatial Contact forces , Rigid transforms, Cartesian and 6-DOF joints , Brick Solids to make this and imported a Shagai Step file.
